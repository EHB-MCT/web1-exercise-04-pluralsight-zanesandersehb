    <h1>Pluralsight Skills</h1>

    <h2>Where teams build better <br />technology skills, faster</h2>

    <p>
      Technology teams are only as successful as their skills are relevant.
      <br />
      Give them access to Pluralsight Skillsâ€”courses, assessments, learning
      paths, and labs <br />
      and you give them the tech fluency they need to build business-critical
      skills.
